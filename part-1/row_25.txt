Q:

Python: My return variable is always None

So I found a strange thing that happens in python whenever I try to return an optional parameter or at least I think that is why it is happening.
Here is my code
def reverse(string, output = ""):
    if string == "":
        print "winner: ", output
        return output
    output = output + string[-1]
    string = string[:-1]
    reverse(string, output=output)

And here is what happens when I run it:
>>> output = reverse("hello")
winner:  olleh
>>> print output
None

Anyone know why my return is always None?

A:

You have to return the return value of the recursive call.
def reverse(string, output = ""):
    if string == "":
        print "winner: ", output
        return output
    output = output + string[-1]
    string = string[:-1]
    return reverse(string, output=output)
