Q:

React typescript ref return null in conditional rendering

I want to use React refs, it works fine in static rendering, e.g:   
<footer ref="ftr"></footer>

But, not in conditional rendering, e.g:
{footer ?
    <footer ref="ftr"></footer>
: null}

When I called ReactDOM.findDOMNode(this.refs.ftr);, the first way returned the element (fine) but the second returned me undefined.
How to do the right way in conditional rendering? Any answer would be appreciated.

A:

You should not use string refs as written in the docs:

We advise against it because string refs have some issues, are
  considered legacy, and are likely to be removed in one of the future
  releases

You can do this:
let footerElement: HTMLElement | null = null;
...
{footer ?
    <footer ref={ el => footerElement = el }></footer>
: null}
...
if (footerElement != null) {
    ...
}
