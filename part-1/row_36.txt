Adventure Time, Mission Impossible, The A-Team, Harry Potter and the new Ghostbusters are about to land on LEGO Dimensions.

Images of the new additions were picked up by users on /r/LEGO, the source of which seems to be early listings on the Mexican version of Amazon. This pretty much breaks the street date of a LEGO Dimensions announcement which is supposed to happen today (June 9th).

The game already features characters, locations, items and more from popular franchises such as DC Comics, Back To The Future and Scooby-Doo.

Adventure Time was already slated to be a LEGO Ideas official set, so it’s appearance on the subreddit wasn’t such a shock. Mission Impossible and The A-Team, on the other hand, are a complete surprise here.

That being said, we still really like these new additions and would love to play them… if it wasn’t for the fact that the game, in any iteration, has still not been released in South Africa.

It was initially released north of the equator on September 27th, so local interested parties have been waiting for it for quite sometime. Hopefully it’ll arrive here soon. We can dream…

UPDATE 09/06:

Thanks to an official trailer made for E3, we now know that the above leaks are all official. To make the news even better (and to empty your wallet even more), E.T., The Goonies, Gremlins, Teen Titans GO!, Knight Rider and even Sonic will be appearing in the game at a future date.
