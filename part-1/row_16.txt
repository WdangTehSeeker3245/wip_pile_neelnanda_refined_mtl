Monday's are never fun...except when it's West Ham Q&A day and that's exactly what it is today!

To say there is a lot going on in the world of West Ham wouldn't quite be true as, in all honesty, its been fairly quiet. Last week, there was transfer movement on a couple of fronts and the club also sealed the free transfer of Ryan Fredericks from Fulham on a four-year deal.

There is still little to no progress on moves for Felipe Anderson and Marlon Santos, while the Hammers were also dealt a disastrous injury blow in Barcelona.

In training with Argentina, Manuel Lanzini ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee and football.london understands that it's a whole lot worse than first feared and the attacking midfielder could miss the entire 2018/19 season in a worse case scenario.

That will no doubt impact on Manuel Pellegrini's transfer plans for the remainder of the window, with any moves now unlikely to happen until after the World Cup.

We also had news from the continent on Monday about where West Ham are set to be based for ten days of their pre-season tour this summer, more of which you will find out about later in the live blog.
